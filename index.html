            <p>
                So as is well-documented, <span class="italic">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span> came out the same day as Doom Eternal; cue lots
                of photoshops of THE DOOM SLAYER chasing lost souls with a butterfly net. Lollety lol, memety meme. But
                the two are a weirdly good pairing; what better way to unwind from a high-tension gameplay experience
                than with something cheerful, relaxing, and colorful like Doom Eternal? Yeah, you figured out where this
                joke was going half a sentence ago, I'm sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that Nintendo have got this whole console thing down, a version of <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> for the Switch
                was inevitable. <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> is an institution, at this point; one that requires commitment, and as
                such, I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who thinks they're ready to be committed to an institution.
                The setup this time around is that you and the predatory raccoon loan shark, Tom Nook, have come to a
                desert island wilderness in order to develop it into yet another wholesome capitalist paradise for
                animal-shaped random number generators; you know, the kind of setup where, if it were a film, you'd
                expect half the cast to be cannibalized by the end of Act Two. But don't worry! Tom Nook presumably
                massacred the native island population before we arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of developing the island largely entails, for your part, the transfer of ungodly amounts of
                bells from you to Tom Nook's holdings account, and the usual <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> routine quickly sets in:
                you fish, you catch bugs, you acquire furniture, you sell it all to Tom Nook for money that you then use
                to pay off your loans to Tom Nook. It's the all-Tom Nook economy; when Tom Nook dies, this entire
                society will fucking collapse into anarchy where brightly-colored animal people shiv each other for
                pears. And as always, you're expected to come back every day in real time to pull the weeds, dig up a
                new set of fossils, and defuse any shiv-based arguments. Very little that I didn't already comment on
                the last time my path was crossing with Animal... game. With the animal game.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I managed to gain a new perspective on Animal Tossing this time around by introducing my wife to it.
                Now, be warned before you show your significant other or cohabitant <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> that it's a risky
                play; on the one hand, they won't yell at you to stop playing video games for a while, but on the other,
                the house will rot and the children will starve. I'm ashamed to admit that I knew <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> would
                suck her in, 'cos she's one of those "100% completion" types who've always ensured that Pok√©mon makes
                bank like a 7-Eleven across the road from a marijuana shop. So on Day 1, she was saying she probably
                wouldn't be into it, and by Day 5, she was staying up fishing long into the night 'cos she had to catch
                just one fucking sturgeon before the end of March. And by Day 8, she was digging holes in a series of
                arcane patterns in the hope of summoning a tarantula to catch, and I began to worry that she might have
                joined a cargo cult.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I was gathering all kinds of interesting data on the communal experience of Animal Crossing; for
                example, kids, the first of your siblings who gets to play <span class="italic">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span> is officially
                the one your parents love the most. The first player gets a fun little sequence where they camp out with
                Tom Nook and get gently tutorialized, and get to name the island and pick where all the characters'
                houses go so they can start a beaver ghetto if they feel so inclined. And the next player to join on the
                same Switch gets "Oh, hello! You're here, too! Here are some old twigs we found; try not to get them
                dirty. What's that? You'd like to have your own island to play with? Well, you see that dung beetle over
                there? You see how he's eating shit? I think you could learn a lot from his example."
            </p>
            <p>
                There's this whole new system of etiquette one must adhere to when other people in the household are
                playing Animal Crossing. Is the first person to log on that day duty-bound to dig up all the fossils? If
                my cohabitee sends me a hat they designed, is a token "thank you" reply enough, or am I obliged to wear
                the awful fucking thing? If they spend hours grinding fish bait trying to catch a blue marlin, and I
                catch one entirely by chance on my first go, how many is an inappropriate number of pelvic thrusts to do
                in their stupid, crying face? And so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for how New Horizons compares to previous incarnations, there's a greater sense in this one that the
                environment is growing and developing as time goes on. At first, it's all tents and temporary housing;
                no shop, no museum, most of it's locked behind impassible rivers and cliffs. But with time, several
                large payments to Tom Nook, and enough inevitable fucking crafting to soak up more PVA glue than any
                unsupervised schoolchild could consume in a lifetime, you gradually turn this mysterious exotic
                wilderness into yet another <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> consumerist hellhole identical to the last one; Tom Nook is
                the living embodiment of the gray goo scenario. You could call the development of the island the game's
                "story campaign", if you want, much as that would be like putting a dead dog on a swing and calling it
                an "adventure playground", but that might be missing the point, because the point of <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> is
                that there is no point; oh, there are plenty of overt challenges you can distract yourself with - get
                all of the fish, get all of the furniture, make all the animal people dress up in swastika-patterned
                jumpers - but all that matters is that you are distracted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, obviously, Nintendo didn't know a pandemic and global lockdown was going to happen, and I'm
                certainly not saying they orchestrated it alongside a shadowy cabal of global corporations to reaffirm
                their grip on power - to reiterate, I am NOT saying that, Nintendo; you can stop sending the frighteners
                'round now - but <span class="italic">Animal Crossing</span> couldn't have come out at a better time, because it offers something
                that is sorely needed: stability. Keep hold of your Nintendo Switch through every water war and bandit
                raid in the coming years, and you will always have a little place that will never change, where the
                grass is always green and the peaches always look like tiny pairs of perfect buttocks, and where the owl
                at the museum always says the exact same nineteen fucking lines of dialogue when I just wanted to assess
                some fucking fossils and shut his fucking face!
            </p>
            <p>
                "But do you like <span class="italic">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span>, Yahtzee?" See, that's the wrong question. Of course I
                don't, but I still play it; it's full of little annoyances I could nitpick about, but I strongly suspect
                it's the flaws that make it absorbing. Of course smacking rocks doesn't just drop crafting resources; it
                has to parcel them out based on how many times you can smack it in ten seconds, so you feel motivated to
                try and beat that record. Of course you can't skip the interminably repetitive dialogue and fish puns,
                because our eventual payout for the morning's fishing will be all the sweeter for having put in the
                slog. Of course the owl always says the same fucking thing, because if they said something different for
                once, we'd all be struck with terror at the sudden injection of chaos into our ordered little world, the
                way a suburban community reacts when a black person moves in.
            </p>
            <p>
                And annoying as it is that there's only so much you can do until you have to wait another day, it's
                well-documented that that's how these games turn into habits. If you set out to masturbate once a day,
                within about two weeks, you're not even doing it because you want to anymore; you're all like, "Well,
                what can I do? Hands tied! It's wank o'clock."
